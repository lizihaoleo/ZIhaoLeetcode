Since we applied the Union-Find data structure in our algorithm, we would like to start with a statement on the time complexity of the data structure, as follows:

Statement: If MM operations, either Union or Find, are applied to NN elements, the total run time is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={O}(M \cdot \log^{*}{N})">, where logâˆ— is the iterated logarithm.
